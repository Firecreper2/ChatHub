# ChatHub
A website that I made initially for my brother to hack into with Linux. Then we realised the entirety of the school wifi was connected, so we were able to talk to each other ANYWHERE on our county
So now it is spicy~~
# Installation
Warning - VERY inefficient
1. Clone the directory and run npm install
2. Run `npm install colors`
3. Create file "messages.json" with contents "[]"
4. Create file "users.json" with contents "{}"
5. Run `node .`
